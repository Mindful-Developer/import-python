=========================================
Welcome to import-python's documentation!
=========================================

**import-python** - Python's built-in functions, classes and (some) modules ported to 
JavaScript. Most are pretty close to the same functionality as the python version 
of the function or class.

Completed modules:
  - core (base python without importing)
  - random
  - itertools
  - string

.. note::

   **this module is not web friendly (please up import-python-web for web projects)**
   This project is under active development.
